        If you want to achieve your goals, then follow me and my guide to success. A last piece of advice: First person narrative or third person narrative, it doesnâ€™t matter as long as your content is interesting. Consider your professional bio as as any other write up and make sure that itâ€™s interesting. Also, do not brag too much about yourselves and annoy your audience. Rest of the things will follow. By focusing on making sure my company ends up on top every year and generating the most money, Abhay has been able to put the business certifications I earned at business school to good use. Over the years, my strengths at the company have garnered some recognition for making the most profit. Abhay may spend his days working, but itâ€™s the thrill of money and the glory of coming in first that gets him up in the morning.
